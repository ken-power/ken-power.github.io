## The Foobar Challenge

The Foobar Challenge is Google's semi-secret coding challenge. The Foobar challenge has five levels with roughly increasing difficulty. Each level has one or more challenges that must be completed in sequence, for a total of 9 challenges. Part of the challenge is to understand what, exactly, the problem is. While the problem might be phrased in terms of intercepting secret notes, rescuing bunnies, distracting bunny trainers, or dodging lasers, solving the challenge involves recognizing that the problem and solution are based on concepts such as ciphers, graph algorithms, shortest path algorithms, or mathematical sequences.

For each challenge, I provide my solution code and some background notes on my implementation choices. I also provide the source code for the tests I developed using the `unittest` framework.

See [the code](https://github.com/ken-power/Foobar_Challenge) for this project.
